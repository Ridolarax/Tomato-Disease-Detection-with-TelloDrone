# Integration of Drone Technology with EfficientNet for Real-Time Tomato Leaf Disease Classification

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model for detecting tomato leaf diseases using the EfficientNetB5 architecture. The system is designed to work with real-time drone footage to classify different diseases on tomato plants. 
The Model was trained on open-source dataset from kaggle.
